# intution:  All the numbers are positive that's why there is never backtrack optionn if you are going to fill number
row wise that's why You have to choose the minimum number that you can put in that particular cell and after performing this operation you will get matrix easily


class Solution {
public:
    vector<vector<int>> restoreMatrix(vector<int>& row, vector<int>& col) {
        int r=row.size();
        int c=col.size();
        
        vector<vector<int>>ans(r,vector<int>(c,0));
        for(int i=0;i<r;i++)
        {
            for(int j=0;j<c;j++)
            {
                ans[i][j]=min(row[i],col[j]);
                row[i]-=ans[i][j];
                col[j]-=ans[i][j];
